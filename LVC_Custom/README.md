This board implements Low Voltage Cutoff (LVC) and reverse polarity protection funcitonality. It is currently designed for 1S, 2S, or 3S LiPo batteries. It features XT60 connectors and is relatively small. The FETs selected are P-Channel not the best on resistance but should be able to conduct at least 4A relatively easily.
